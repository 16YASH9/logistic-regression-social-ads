# Logistic Regression – Social Network Ads

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their **Age** and **Estimated Salary**.


## 📌 Overview

- 📊 Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- 🧼 Preprocessed the dataset
- 🔍 Scaled the features for better model performance
- 🧠 Applied Logistic Regression (binary classification)
- 📈 Evaluated with Accuracy, Confusion Matrix & Classification Report
- 📍 Visualized predictions with a simple scatter plot
  

## 📁 Dataset

- Dataset used: `Social_Network_Ads.csv`
- Contains:
  - `Age`
  - `EstimatedSalary`
  - `Purchased` (target: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn


## 📈 Model Evaluation

- ✅ Accuracy Score: ~89%
- 🧮 Confusion Matrix & Classification Report used for evaluation


## 📷 Visualization

- Scatter plot showing predicted classifications  
- Green = Purchased | Red = Not Purchased


## ✅ Conclusion

- Logistic Regression is effective for binary classification tasks
- Scaling and proper feature selection improves results
